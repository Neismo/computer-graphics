a) What is the difference between Phong shading and Phong lighting (the 
Phong reflection model)? 

b) What is the difference between flat shading, Gouraud shading, and Phong 
shading? List pros and cons of each. Is Gouraud or Phong shading the 
best method for simulating highlights? Explain. 

c) What is the difference between a directional light and a point light? 
	A point light would have a position, and light emitted from this would differ from a directional light, whose light rays are all parallel.

d) Does the eye position influence the shading of an object in any way? 
	Yes, when it comes to reflection or the specular lighting, it does matter where the eye position is at, because we utilize the vector torwads the eye in that lighting 		computation.
	
e) What is the effect of setting the specular term to (0, 0,0)? f) What is the effect of increasing the shininess exponent (ùõº)? 

g) In what coordinate space did you compute the lighting?
	I did my lighting calculations in object space, not in eye space. It seems to be a cheaper calculation to do, instead of also multiplying with the view matrix.
